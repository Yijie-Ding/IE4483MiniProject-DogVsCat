# Dog vs. Cat Image Classification Project

## Overview
This project implements a binary image classification model that distinguishes between images of dogs and cats. 
Built using deep learning techniques, the classifier can process input images and predict whether they contain a dog or a cat with a certain level of accuracy.

## Model Architecture
The project explores various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures ranging from simple baseline models to advanced structures incorporating layers from the VGG16 model for feature extraction. Techniques
